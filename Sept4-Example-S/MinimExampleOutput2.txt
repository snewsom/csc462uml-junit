Simplex minimisation, using the method of Nelder and Mead,
of the function y = f(c[0], c[1], c[2] . . .)

Value of parameters at the minimum
 
             	Value at     	Initial      	Initial
             	mimium       	estimate     	step
c[0]         	1.1708E-8    	1.0          	0.2
c[1]         	-4.2935E-5   	3.0          	0.6
